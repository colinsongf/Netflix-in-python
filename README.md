Repo for netflix code

This code emulates the netflix prize, written in python. 
The Netflix Prize sought to substantially improve the accuracy of predictions about how much someone is going to enjoy a movie based on their movie preferences.
Given a data set of over 100 million ratings from around 500,000 customers, an algorithm was developed to predict the
rating a specific user would give to a specific movie, the algorith was tested with 1000 lines of acceptance code to produce
an RMSE( Root Mean Squared error) of less then 1.0 against the actual ratings in the data sets.
